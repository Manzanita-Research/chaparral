# Chaparral

If you work across multiple repos that share an identity — a design language, a set of AI coding skills, a voice — you know the drift. You update the brand guidelines in one place and forget to propagate. You add a new skill and three repos never hear about it. The connective tissue between your projects is copy-paste and good intentions.

Chaparral is a small, warm CLI that keeps your organization's shared context alive across every repo. Point it at a brand repo containing your Claude Code skills and org-level instructions, and it links them into every sibling project with a single command. New repo? It's already connected. New skill? Sync once and every project has it. It works through symlinks — no copies, no drift, one source of truth rooted in version control where it belongs.

Multi-org by default. If you're a studio, an agency, a freelancer with multiple clients — each org gets its own brand repo, its own skills, its own identity. Chaparral finds them all and manages them from one dashboard.

Claude Code has a plugin marketplace now, and that's great for distribution. But marketplaces copy files to a cache, require per-repo configuration, and need manual updates after changes. When you're in the thick of developing shared skills — writing a new design system, tuning a brand voice, building the slash commands your team actually uses — you need something that moves at the speed of thought. Edit a skill in your brand repo, and it's live in every sibling project before you switch terminals. That's what symlinks give you that caches can't.

Chaparral is where skills are born. The marketplace is where they graduate to. Develop locally, publish when stable. One tool for the workbench, another for the storefront.

We built this because Manzanita Research needed it. We have a growing family of projects — each named after a California native plant, each with its own purpose — and they all need to speak the same language, use the same design sensibility, carry the same values into every interface. Chaparral is the ecosystem that holds them together. The underground network. Named for the dense, interconnected brushland where manzanita grows wild on California hillsides — because that's what good shared context feels like. Not a monorepo. Not a platform. Just roots, running between the trees.

With love from California.
