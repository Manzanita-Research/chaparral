# Chaparral

If you work across multiple repos that share an identity — a design language, a set of AI coding skills, a voice — you know the drift. You update the brand guidelines in one place and forget to propagate. You add a new skill and three repos never hear about it. The connective tissue between your projects is copy-paste and good intentions.

Chaparral is a small, warm CLI that keeps your organization's shared context alive across every repo. Point it at a brand repo containing your Claude Code skills and org-level instructions, and it links them into every sibling project with a single command. New repo? It's already connected. New skill? Sync once and every project has it. It works through symlinks — no copies, no drift, one source of truth rooted in version control where it belongs.

We built this because Manzanita Research needed it. We have a growing family of projects — each named after a California native plant, each with its own purpose — and they all need to speak the same language, use the same design sensibility, carry the same values into every interface. Chaparral is the ecosystem that holds them together. The underground network. Named for the dense, interconnected brushland where manzanita grows wild on California hillsides — because that's what good shared context feels like. Not a monorepo. Not a platform. Just roots, running between the trees. With love from California.
